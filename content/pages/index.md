        content: >
          The Shadows were created long time ago when the world needed the most.
          These Shadows are here again to help people in need. Each and one of
          them has a certain Ability that is able to defeat those that are doing
          bad things. Even if they have no face and some might look evil, they
          are working from behind to help the vulnerable people. Do not be
          afraid of their appearance. The creator made them with no face as they
          don't need to be revered as they are ment to do good.
